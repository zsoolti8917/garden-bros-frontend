# Feature Specification: Static Website Migration

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to rebuild my existing gardening website, which currently relies on a Strapi backend, into a fully static website. The goal is to simplify the project by removing backend dependencies, reducing maintenance, and ensuring faster load times. All content should be delivered directly from the frontend, making the site lightweight, reliable, and easy to host anywhere."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Website visitors should experience the same gardening service information, portfolio content, and contact capabilities as the current dynamic website, but with significantly faster page load times and improved reliability. Site administrators should be able to maintain content without requiring backend infrastructure or database management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor accesses any page of the website, **When** the page loads, **Then** all content displays correctly and loads in under 3 seconds
2. **Given** the website is hosted on any static hosting platform, **When** visitors browse the site, **Then** all functionality works identically to the current dynamic version
3. **Given** content needs to be updated, **When** administrators modify content files, **Then** changes can be deployed without requiring database or server management
4. **Given** a visitor browses the portfolio, **When** viewing service galleries, **Then** images load quickly and display optimally across all devices
5. **Given** a visitor wants to contact the business, **When** using contact forms, **Then** inquiries are submitted successfully without backend processing

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the static hosting platform experiences downtime?
- How does build-time optimization handle extremely large galleries (100+ images)?
- What occurs when the form maintenance message is displayed for extended periods?
