# Research: Static Website Migration

**Phase 0 Output** | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Feature**: Static Website Migration

## Research Areas

### 1. Static Site Generation with Next.js
**Decision**: Use Next.js 14.2.3 with app directory and static export
**Rationale**: Next.js provides excellent static site generation, build-time optimization, image optimization, and TypeScript support. The app directory offers better performance and developer experience.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Gatsby: More complex setup, GraphQL layer unnecessary for this use case
- Nuxt.js: Vue-based, would require framework migration
- Astro: Less mature ecosystem, team familiarity with React/Next.js

### 2. Content Management Strategy
**Decision**: Netlify CMS for git-based content management
**Rationale**: Provides user-friendly admin interface while keeping content in git repository. No external dependencies, integrates well with static hosting platforms.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Sanity/Contentful: Adds external API dependency, against static-first approach
- Manual file editing: Too technical for content administrators
- Forestry: Being deprecated in favor of TinaCMS

### 3. Form Processing Solution
**Decision**: Netlify Forms with Formspree as fallback
**Rationale**: Netlify Forms integrates seamlessly with static hosting, no external configuration needed. Formspree provides reliable fallback option.
**Alternatives considered**:
- EmailJS: Client-side only, potential security concerns
- Custom webhook: Adds backend dependency
- Mailto links: Poor user experience

### 4. Image Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Next.js Image component with build-time optimization
**Rationale**: Automatically generates responsive variants in WebP/AVIF formats, lazy loading, size optimization. Meets constitutional performance requirements.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual optimization: Time-consuming, error-prone
- CDN-based optimization: Adds external dependency
- Runtime optimization: Not available in static builds

### 5. Internationalization Approach
**Decision**: Next.js i18n with locale-based routing
**Rationale**: Built-in Next.js feature, static generation friendly, SEO optimized with proper URL structure.
**Alternatives considered**:
- react-i18next: More complex setup, runtime overhead
- Manual route handling: Difficult to maintain
- Subdomain approach: DNS complexity

### 6. Performance Monitoring
**Decision**: Lighthouse CI with Core Web Vitals tracking
**Rationale**: Automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline, constitutional compliance verification.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual testing: Not scalable, prone to oversight
- Third-party monitoring: Adds cost and complexity
- Browser dev tools only: No continuous monitoring

### 7. Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E, Lighthouse for performance
**Rationale**: Comprehensive coverage of functionality, accessibility, and performance requirements from constitution.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Cypress: Good but Playwright has better cross-browser support
- Testing Library only: Insufficient for full-stack testing
- Manual testing only: Not sustainable for CI/CD

## Implementation Notes

### Build-Time Optimization
- Image optimization with responsive variants
- CSS/JS minification and tree-shaking
- Static HTML generation for all routes
- Sitemap and robots.txt generation

### Content Migration Strategy
- Complete content recreation (as clarified)
- Preserve URL structure for SEO
- Maintain multilingual content structure
- Update internal links and references

### Deployment Strategy
- Vercel for primary hosting (Next.js optimization)
- Netlify as secondary option (CMS integration)
- GitHub Pages as backup option
- All platforms support static hosting requirements

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- Large image galleries: Implement pagination and lazy loading
- Build time optimization: Use incremental static regeneration if needed
- Bundle size: Code splitting and dynamic imports

### Content Management Risks
- CMS learning curve: Provide admin training and documentation
- Git conflicts: Implement branch protection and review process
- Content backup: Regular automated backups of content repository

### SEO Risks
- URL changes: Implement redirects for changed URLs
- Meta data: Ensure all pages have proper titles and descriptions
- Schema markup: Maintain business information structured data
